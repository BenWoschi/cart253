## Description

> Variation Jam: A game about dodging obstacles and slowing down time in a speeder across a vast cyberpunk cityscape.

> It is quite simple, move left, right, up or down with WASD to dodge incoming obstacles and increase your score. Use SHIFT to slow down time for a few seconds and squeeze out of tight situations.

> This project was built upon the variation menu template. I had the idea of a flappybird-esque game where you have to dodge incoming objects with increasing difficulty. I was inspired for the themeing based off of a difficult synthwave-themed speeder/racer game named Redout 2.
