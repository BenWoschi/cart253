Mod Jam Response

I’ll start by saying the visual fidelity in this assignment was definitely a step up from the art jam. Functionality-wise, though, a lot of the projects felt repetitive. They were still fun, but the repetition kind of comes with the nature of the mod jam. We’re all working off existing code and trying to make it our own, which is definitely a skill in itself. With that in mind, that’s basically how I’m judging things, how well people shaped the template into something that feels like their project.

First up is Sama’s Consumed Locusts. Immediately, I love the whole retro metroid-horror vibe, with grotesque pixel monsters, trippy colours, dark atmosphere. It really feels like something that could exist on some old cartridge system. The lack of audio is a shame because it would’ve pushed the atmosphere even further. The main player... ship? I’m honestly not sure, but visually it’s a letdown. It’s just two rectangles, which clashes with everything else that looks way more detailed and intentional. Conceptually, the game is cool. You have to locate the enemies first, then clear them out and fight the boss. Coding-wise, there’s a solid understanding of what we’ve learned so far. Lots of loops, a couple of arrays, and newer concepts since the art jam. The functionality, however, needs work. The health bar can’t actually hit zero, so you never get a loss screen. And the boss can’t die either as the health just goes into the negative, so the win screen never appears. Movement for the player would add some actual challenge (dodging shots, positioning, etc.), and letting the player shoot instead of just clicking everything would make it way more engaging. Visually, the game almost nails its theme, but the gameplay holds it back.

Next is Pansy’s CatCatCat which I find to be simply cute, in a very literal sense. The visuals are simple, but they work. The switching emojis and bouncing little cat make it more fun to look at. The art could be pushed further, but what’s here gets the job done. Functionality is also simple, as the base template is still very visible. Even the frog and fly variable names remain, just repurposed for the cat game, which could confuse someone reading the code for the first time. The project hits the required features but doesn’t stretch much beyond that. There are two tiny details that really sold me, though. One: the losing dialogue changes depending on how many cats you caught, which gives it personality. Two: the emoji briefly cries when you miss a cat, and it’s so subtle but genuinely charming. Overall, it’s a simple game, but between the audio, visuals, and those tiny touches, it has a charm that sticks.

Finally, Noureddine’s Frog Game. And honestly? It feels straight out of an early-2000s Flash game site, and I mean that as a big compliment. The UI is clean, the visuals are really well done, and the little head-tilt animation when the frog launches its tongue adds so much character. The audio and sound effects are perfect for this style, and the bubbly almost-3D aesthetic nails that Flash-game look. My only tiny visual critique is that the fly is literally just a black circle, but that’s nothing major. Functionality is smooth and pretty simple. The code reflects that too. I think the gameplay could’ve used a tiny bit more depth or extra mechanics, but at the same time, simplicity fits this genre really well. The visual presentation honestly does most of the heavy lifting; in a good way.
