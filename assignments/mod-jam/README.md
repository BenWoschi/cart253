## Description

> Mod Jam: Battle of the Croaks is a program where you eat flies and compete against an unnatural toad.

> It is quite simple, just move left or right with the mouse and time your clicks so that the tongue catches the flies.

> This project was built upon Pippin's frogfrogfrog idea, with an added competitive toad thrown into the mix. The Hypno Toad has no use for his tongue as he simply lures the flies into his mouth with his hypnotic eyes. He is a tyrant that steals other frog's and toad's dinner. Eat more flies than him to not go hungry and prove that his reign is not absolute.
