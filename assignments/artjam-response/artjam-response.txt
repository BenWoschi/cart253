Art Jam Response

I want to begin this response by saying that overall, people did an excellent job in combining both functionality and visual fidelity to accomplish some astounding and more importantly, fun experiences. I chose three projects to examine (almost) at random and will tackle each separately. 

First up is Blaise’s scenic depiction of an outdoor camping spot. The composition utilizes warm and lower saturation hues to give a sense of warmth and comfort while the sun is up, which contrasts the chilling and vibrant blues of the mountains in the background. The use of simple shapes is well done and makes the different elements in the composition easily stand out from each other. The mouse position on the x-axis darkens the sky when moving to the right of the page, and sets the firepit alight. However, this is where my issues with it arise. This remains the only functionality that is present within the piece, maybe clicking the mouse to flicker the fire or to even put it out would be a nice touch, and there should be a limit to the fire when moving the cursor, as it just flips the flame around when moving it far enough. Furthermore, it’s a nice touch that the interior of the tent darkens when it turns night, but the sun itself does not move, nor does the ground darken. Aside from the sky, many things remain stagnant. On the whole, he demonstrates a very solid understanding at creating complex shapes within the canvas, but seems to struggle in terms of functionality. 

Next is Weini Wang’s self portrait of a frog, and right off the bat, this has to be my all-time personal favourite. The chibi art style that is depicted plays right into the simple shapes we actually know how to code in p5.js, and uses that limited toolkit as a strength rather than a weakness. Pairing the art style with the cute and vibrant colours present throughout the project lends itself to having a very solid and visually pleasing composition overall. The changing blush on the frog cheeks and random nature of the snowflakes were well done, especially the latter, utilizing more advanced for loops. However, while I really enjoyed the blinking eyes, my only criticism would be that they weren’t that apparent, as I thought they flipped at random intervals similarly to the snowflakes. However, this is ultimately a very minor criticism. Overall, I thought the functionality was well executed with very cute visuals to match, leading to a very fun and pleasant experience. 

Lastly is Ziyan (Pansy) Pan’s portrayal. Similar to me, they used a specific flower to represent themselves. The blues of the flower contrast nicely with each other and the shapes do their job at defining the pansy flower and making it visually distinct. Unfortunately, the project overall shows their lack of understanding in regards to p5.js. Aside from the flower moving with mouseX and Y, there remains no other functionality present within the project. Furthermore, they failed to draw the background which leads to the flower constantly drawing itself across the screen, and the presence of strokes around each individual shape does hurt the overall flower visual. I really admire that they went with a flower to represent themselves, so it pains me that it wasn’t executed better. With a better understanding and further guidance, I believe they could have really created something more fun.
