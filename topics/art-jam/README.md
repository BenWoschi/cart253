## Description

> Art Jam: Self-Discovery is a program in which you discover yourself within a dark void.

> It is quite simple, no clicking of any kind is required, just hovering your mouse around the screen to discover the flower.

> The project is more accurately a representation of myself and how I felt during the brainstorming process of this project, as well as in general. To this day I still struggle to understand myself and finding my own self worth, I struggle to understand what makes me, well.. me, and what that represents. I used the imagery of a flower as I am obsessed with lotus flowers in particular, but I didn't have the skillset to draw one within the program. It was really the only thing that I thought represented me in a more abstract way.
